- Use imperative mood
- Limit summary line to 50 characters
- Add description (why/impact) in a new paragraph
- Mention related tickets in square brackets (e.g., [BC-101])
- Include AL object IDs and object types where applicable
- Default to 'chore' when unsure
- Avoid vague messages like 'update code'
